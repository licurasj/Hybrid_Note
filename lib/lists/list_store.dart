// Where the screens read and write lists. LocalListStore keeps today's
// storage behind it (AppData with Drive sync for the built-ins, a local file
// for the user's own lists); FirestoreListStore will implement the same
// interface and run the same contract tests
// (test/lists/list_store_contract_test.dart).
//
// Fit for Firestore (Q-5 A: lists/{listId} with an items subcollection, in
// the list engine JSON format):
// - Every write is async and may finish after the UI moved on; the read side
//   reports the result, so callers do not wait for it to redraw.
// - The read side is not one coherent snapshot per write (D-12): a store may
//   merge a listener on the lists with one per list's items, so after the
//   initial load a change may arrive in steps (a list before its items, a
//   deleted list's items after the list). Only the initial load is whole.
// - Ids are made by the client (list and item ids are UUID-based), so a
//   write never waits for the store to hand out an id.
// - patchList applies the ops on the store's current data, not on what the
//   caller saw (Q-12 A), so two devices do not overwrite each other. In
//   Firestore that needs a transaction; a transaction reads documents, not a
//   query, so how it also covers an item added meanwhile by another device
//   is FirestoreListStore's to settle and test (T-14).
// - deleteList is a subtree delete (the list document and all its items); it
//   returns what restoreList needs to bring both back (Undo, D-5).
// - A store may refuse a write. patchList and createList return the reasons
//   and change nothing in that case.

  // one after each change, possibly in several steps (see above). current is
